[{"tags":"War","date":"1914-06-28","title":"Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand","country":"Yugoslavia","description":"In 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to Austria-Hungary, was shot in Sarajevo by members of a militant Serb nationalist group known as the Black Hand. While meaningful in it's own right, the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand is best remembered for setting in motion the series of events that would lead to the downfall of the land empires that had dominated Europe for centuries. Austria, blaming Serbia, declared war, hoping to strike quickly and put an end to any other nation-states that thought they could compete with a multi-national empire. However, no side won immediately, and various other powers joined the conflict until the entire continent was engulfed in World War.","quoteCitation":null,"citations":"Lecture 1","quote":null},{"tags":"Treaty","date":"1915-04-26","title":"Treaty of London","country":"Yugoslavia","description":"At the time, many expected Italy to join the World War on the side of the Austrian empire. But, behind closed doors, the Italians negotiated with the Entente powers and joined the war on the other side, with promises of Austrian land if the Entente were to emerge victorious. This thinking is emblematic of the time period: empires didn't have to respect the smaller nation-states, and could divvy up their land amongst themselves as they saw fit.","quoteCitation":"Banac 117","citations":"Lecture 2","quote":"From the outset the JO was impeded \u2026 by the attitude of the Entente governments, whose war aims did not yet include the breakup of Austria-Hungary\u2026. [they] saw the South Slavic question as a nuisance that should be treated as convenience suited, in whatever way did the most to shorten the war. The terms for Italy's accession to the Allied side were the gravest case in point: the secret Treaty of London which the Entente powers concluded with Italy on April 26, 1\u00b7915, promised Italy extensive territories \u2026 in exchange for a declaration of war on Austria-Hungary."},{"tags":"Social Movement","date":"1917-03-08","title":"Bolshevik Revolution","country":"Russia","description":"The Bolshevik Revolution may be the event that had the biggest impact in shaping Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In 1917, Vladimir Lenin turned Russian society upside down with the success of the Bolshevik Revolution. Lenin, acting on behalf of the masses, executed a successful communist revolution in Russia. To Lenin, this revolution was only meant to be the beginning. Because it was successful in Russia, Lenin saw it as part of the inexorable march toward communism that Marx predicted, and he assumed that soon the rest of the world would follow. ","quoteCitation":"Snyder, Timothy. Bloodlands (p. 5). Basic Books. Kindle Edition.\u00a0","citations":"Lecture 7","quote":"Surely, reasoned the Bolsheviks, the German Empire would soon collapse along with the rest of the oppressive capitalist system, and Russian and other revolutionaries could spread their new order westward, to these terrains and beyond. The war, Lenin and Trotsky argued, would bring inevitable German defeat on the western front and then a workers\u2019 revolution within Germany itself."},{"tags":null,"date":"1917-07-20","title":"Corfu
